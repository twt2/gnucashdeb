	  #645352: Customer and Vendor Reports should have separate income
	  and expense subtotals per period; error if 'Amount' is not
	  selected Patch by Chris Curtis: Add 'Credit' and 'Debit' columns
	  and options; fix error if 'Amount' is not selected. For tax
	  purposes it would be helpful if the customer and vendor reports
	  included the totals for the amounts earned, received, or billed
	  for a given time period. The reports currently give a total,
	  which is (if you're lucky) zero because the credits cancel out
	  the debits. But for verifying or providing the amounts of a
	  1099-MISC, for instance, the report should show just the amounts
	  credited or debited depending on your business' accounting
	  method. Secondarily, if the 'Amount' column is deselected the
	  report fails with an error. The attached patch both corrects
	  this problem and adds the requested features. The new columns
	  are labeled simply 'Credit' and 'Debit' and do not attempt
	  context-aware naming ("Paid", "Billed", etc.) for simplicity and
	  applicability (cash versus accrual accounting). The columns
	  contain a running total, and the final totals appear in a line
	  above the Amount (running) total. If the beginning period splits
	  an invoice/payment pair an opening balance appears and is
	  accounted for in the Amount total as before, but is not included
	  in the Credit/Debit totals as it is outside the reporting
	  period. If the Amount column is not selected for display then
	  neither is the opening balance, even if it otherwise would have
	  been.

	* [r20478] src/import-export/import-backend.c: Bug #645406: Make

	  Patch by gnemas: The function split_find_match() in
	  import-backend.c scores transactions according to comparisons of
	  amount, date, description, etc. I noticed that the comparison of
	  the description and memo fields is case-sensitive. This means
	  that my supermarket entries that have descriptions "Giant Food"
	  do not match the downloaded descriptions "GIANT FOOD". This
	  applies to both the exact and the 50% match cases, and for both
	  the memo and the description fields. The attached patch should

	  (everything is under gnucash/src/report): - In function

	  argument, closing entries can be ignored (they are identified by
	  xaccTransGetIsClosingTxn). - Some report utility functions are
	  duplicated (with a "-with closing" suffix) to provide the legacy
	  feature. - Equity statement and Profit & Loss reports are

	  gnc_ui_account_get_tax_info_sub_acct_string. Modify

	  displays only the the data in the

	  expanded; otherwise it combines it with the data in the
	  GNC_TREE_MODEL_ACCOUNT_COL_TAX_INFO_SUB_ACCT model column.
	  Modily the view creation function to use the new
	  tax_info_data_func for the text after having first set it to

	  Bug #640233: Don't add "Account unknown Bank Unknown" memo when
	  account and/or bank does not exist Patch by Jeff Kletsky: At
	  least for the online OFX sources I use in the US, downloaded
	  transactions are populated with memos of "Account unknown Bank
	  unknown" Past being annoying, this can cause improper "matches"
	  when comparing transactions. The root cause is found in
	  src/import-export/aqbanking/gnc-ab-utils.c in the function
	  gnc_ab_memo_to_gnc where the code seems to check for the
	  existence of a remote account number from the aqbanking
	  transaction if (ab_other_accountid && *ab_other_accountid) and
	  appears to intend to return the empty string if one is not
	  present. However, an earlier line in the code sets
	  ab_other_accountid to "unknown" so that the test always returns
	  true. This patch should return: * "Account <account number> Bank
	  <bank number>" if both are present * "Account <account number>"
	  if only the account is present * "Bank <bank number>" if only
	  the bank is present * "" if neither is present Additionally,
	  ordering of trimming was changed to handle the possibility that
	  the leading and/or trailing character(s) were stripped as
	  invalid UTF-8, resulting in an untrimmed string.

	  out a dataset to an existing server database (i.e., postgresql
	  or mysql) while maintaining the ability to both
	  transaction-protect saving individual records while maintaining

	  the slots, lots, book accounts, bill terms, customers,
	  employees, entries, invoices, jobs, orders, tax tables and
	  vendors before saving them to the GnuCash XML file. This is an
	  attempt to make saves more idempotent thereby facilitating the
	  use of a revision control system on the GnuCash XML files. With
	  these patches most of the needless and seemingly random churn is
	  gone and I can add or remove a transaction and expect there to
	  be no unrelated changes to the GnuCash file. I've been using and
	  refining this patches for the last few years, so it has received
	  quite a bit of testing. David Fraser adds: Without specific
	  testing, I'm using this on an average-sized gnucash file (5.7MB)
	  without noticing any particular slowdown in saving, but a
	  wonderful reduction in diffs when comparing changes.

	  a GUI for the counter format and current value. Patch by
	  Matthijs Kooijman: This allows the user to change the format
	  used for the various counters, as well as see and change the
	  current value of the counter. This is a bit of hack right now,
	  since the format and current counter values are stored in the
	  counter_formats and counters kvp slots respectively, instead of
	  options/<section> like the other options in the File->properties
	  window. This is implemented by adding the make-counter-option
	  and make-counter-format-option, which both replace the scm->kvp
	  and kvp->scm functions defined by make-number-range-option and
	  make-string-option respectively. The replaced function simply

	  business modules (all using the same format string), the
	  formatting is now moved inside
	  qof_book_increment_and_get_counter (which is renamed to

	  value of a bunch of helper functions from gint64 (the counter
