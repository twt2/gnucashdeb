	  where after setting the columns, clicking OK and selecting a
	  target account, the Date column is lost. This is because of a
	  difference in behaviour on windows and linux. The code attaches
	  to the "edited" signal of the renderer. On linux, this signal is
	  emitted when a new combo box item is selected. On windows, the
	  combo box needs to be selected and focus lost before the signal
	  is emitted. This is changed to the "changed" signal of the
	  renderer which acts as expected on both platforms.

	* [r18893] src/libqof/qof/qofinstance.c,

	  infrastructure so that when deleting an object, it can be
	  determined if there are other objects with references to that
	  object (bug 140400). Some routines are normal routines, and some
	  routines use the gobject structure to allow different
	  implementations by different object types. Per-instance routine:
	  gboolean qof_instance_refers_to_object(QofInstance* A,
	  QofInstance* B) - returns TRUE/FALSE whether object A contains a
	  reference to object B. Normal routine: GList*
	  qof_instance_get_referring_object_list_from_collection(QofCollection*
	  c, QofInstance* B) - Calls qof_instance_refers_to_object() for
	  each object in the collection, and returns a list of the objects
	  which contain a reference to B. Per-instance routine: GList*
	  qof_instance_get_typed_referring_object_list(QofInstance* A,
	  QofInstance* B) - returns a list of all objects of the same type
	  as A which contain a reference to B. Being per-instance allows
	  an object to use knowledge to avoid scanning cases where there
	  are no references (e.g. billterms do not contain references to
	  splits), or a scan is not needed (references from splits to an
	  account can be determined using xaccAccountGetSplitList()). This
	  routine can do a scan by calling
	  qof_instnace_get_referring_object_list_from_collection(). Normal
	  routine: qof_instance_get_referring_object_list(QofInstance* A)
	  - For all collections in the book, gets an instance and calls
	  its qof_instance_get_typed_referring_object_list() routine,
	  concatenating all of the returned lists. This is the routine
	  that external code can call to get a list of all objects with
	  references to an object A. The list must be freed by the caller
	  but the contents must not. Per-instance routine: gchar*
	  qof_instance_get_display_name(QofInstance* A) - returns a string
	  which can identify object A to the user. This could be used to
	  display a list of the objects returned by
	  qof_instance_get_referring_object_list() ("Invoice 0004 for
	  customer C") so that the user can modify those objects to remove
	  the references. Note that this is going to require
	  internationalization, which has not been implemented yet. If not
	  overridden by the object class, the default string is "Object
	  <type> <address>" e.g. "Object gncCustomer 0x12345678".

	  normalized uri format internally to refer to data stores. Data
	  stores for GC can be a file (xml or sqlite3) or a database one
	  some server (mysql or postgres). Wherever it makes sense
	  internally, data stores will be referred to via a normalized
	  uri: protocol://user:password@host:port/path Depending on the
	  context and story type some of these parts are optional or
	  unused. To achieve this, a new utility interface has been setup:
	  gnc_uri_<xxx>_<yyy> that can be used to manipulate the uris or
	  convert from non-normalized formats to normalized and back. For
	  example, when the user selects a file in the Open or Save As
	  dialog, gnc_uri_get_normalized_uri will convert the file into a
	  normalized uri. Or when the actual filename is needed this can
	  be extracted with gnc_uri_get_path. You can also test if a uri
	  defines a file or something else with gnc_uri_is_file_uri. For
	  the complete documentation, see src/core-utils/gnc-uri-uitls.h
	  This commit installs gnc-uri-utils and modifies the source where
	  it makes sense to use its convenience functions. This concerns
	  all functions that had to deal with file access in some way or
	  another, the history module and the functions that generate the
	  history menu list and the window titles. Note that gnc-uri-utils
	  replaces xaccResolveFilePath and xaccResolveUrl in all cases.
	  xaccResolveUrl has been removed, because gnc-uri-utils fully
	  replaces its functionality. xaccResolveFilePath is used
	  internally in gnc-uri-utils to ensure an absolute path is always
	  returned (in case of a file uri, not for db uris). But it has
	  been renamed to gnc_resolve_file_path to be more consistent with
	  the other functions. Lastly, this commit also adds a first
	  implementation to work with a keyring to store and retrieve
	  passwords, althoug

	  gets rid of one level of indirection which makes function lookup
	  easier. Also, the macro (!) qof_book_get_slots was turned into a
	  normal function again because that's what functions are for (and
	  otherwise the additional declaration in engine.i would break).

	* [r18795] src/html/gnc-html-webkit.c: If building for WIN32, use
	  webkit_web_frame_print_full() so that a GtkPrintOperation object
	  with the correct units can be used to prevent font size problems
	  (see bug 591177). On other platforms, use
	  webkit_web_frame_print() because some distros seem not to have
	  webkit_web_frame_print_full() (and also don't have the font size
	  problem so on those distros, we don't need to create our own
	  GtkPrintOperation object).

	  increases the pointer not by a number a bytes but a number of

	* [r18720] src/html/gnc-html-webkit.c: Fix bug 591177: Printer
	  font is too small to read with webkit as html renderer. From
	  comment 23: "The PDF in comment 2 is about 8 times smaller than
	  it should be. One possible cause of this bug is if
	  gtk_print_operation_set_unit (op, GTK_UNIT_POINTS) is not
	  called. gtkprint defaults to GTK_UNIT_PIXEL - a useless unit to
	  be using with printers. On Linux GTK_UNIT_PIXEL units are 1 unit
	  = 1/72 inch (the same as GTK_UNIT_POINTS as well as PostScript
	  and PDF units). On Windows GTK_UNIT_PIXEL units are the GDI
	  device units which for printers is the dpi resolution. So for a
	  600dpi printer 1 unit is 1/600". If the application was
	  developed on Linux and assumes the default gtkprint units are
	  always 1/72" inch the output on Windows using a 600dpi printer
	  will be 72/600 = 0.12 of the size (or approximately 1/8 of the
	  size)." Solution was to use webkit_web_frame_print_full() which
	  allows us to provide our own GtkPrintOperation object with units
	  set to GTK_UNIT_POINTS. Tested on both Linux and Windows.

	  However, we still download the erroneous binary and unpack it
	  into $GNOME_DIR because libgnomeui depends on libbonoboui which
	  in turn depends on libgnome. Hence, libbonoboui cannot be
	  compiled before libgnome-dev is unpacked, but libgnomeui won't
	  report to be installed correctly before libbonoboui is available
	  as well. Theoretically, we would have to split the inst_gnome
	  step so that it first unpacks libgnome et al., then we run the
	  inst_libbonoboui step, then we run the second part of inst_gnome
	  which would be something like inst_gnomeui. I'm lazy, so I
	  silently overwrite the libbonoboui DLL with our hand-compiled
	  version and that's it.

	  set up a client/customer including the name of a recipient when
	  I print an invoice the recipients name ("Account Dept" say) is
	  not printed in the invoice. I think this is a bug rather than a
	  feature. I have attached a patch to fix. It still prints the
	  company name above the recipient name however. I could submit an
	  additional patch to provide an invoice option to toggle printing
	  of the company name if users/developers feel they want this
	  option, as I do.

	  item types. Patch by Thomas Troesch: The proposed patch does: 1.
	  Changes the chk file key to Blocking_Chars as described in
	  607522 ( this had been dropped by mistake ). 2. Add several
	  fields to the Custom tab in the print check dialog. Locations
	  for: a. split memos fields. b. split accounts ( e.g.
	  Expenses:Auto ) c. split amounts ( e.g. GBP 21.40 ) The splits
	  do not include the last split in the transaction. The keys in
	  the chk format file are: SPLITS_AMOUNT SPLITS_MEMO
	  SPLITS_ACCOUNTS 3. Memo was added to the custom tab. This is the
	  memo from the split that matches the account from the register.

	  scenario = John keeps his personal accounting in GnuCash and
	  writes all credit card expenses therein. On weekends, we checks
	  his Internet Banking and sees that some transactions have been
	  recorded. He would like to clear those transactions in GnuCash,
	  but it is tiresome to go through each Internet Banking
	  transaction and do manual comparison with GnuCash records,
	  especially since Internet Banking transactions might be in a
	  different order than in GnuCash. John would prefer having an
	  "auto-clear" feature. Given the "current amount" from the
	  Internet Banking, he would like GnuCash to clear the
	  transactions for him, if and only if, there is a unique
	  combination of transactions that could achieve this. If there is
	  no solution, or if the solution is not unique, GnuCash should
	  warn him and John must manually clear the transactions.

	  #607522: Add ADDRESS to check printing Patch by Thomas Troesch:
	  The patch does three things: 1. Adds the ability to print an
	  address on checks. The Print Check dialog is changed to have 5
	  address lines. The first field is filled in with the same data
	  as the PAYEE check item. The other lines are blank. The check
	  format keys have a new check-item type 'ADDRESS'. It behaves
	  like other text check-item types. The address fields on the
	  dialog are set 'not-sensitive' if the current format does not
	  have an ADDRESS check item defined. The Custom Field tab has a
	  new line for the address location. 2. Added new check format key
	  - Blocking_Chars. This is to put the blocking character feature
	  into the check format file. It is currently only in the
	  preferences dialog in the printing tab, and therefore currently
	  applies (or not) to all text fields in th_e check format. By
	  adding the key Blocking_Chars_n to the check format, the
	  blocking characters can be applied to text type check-items
	  individually. Its really useful when printing stubs and so on.
	  (NOTE: blocking characters are printed around a field to protect
	  against alteration e.g. ***$100.00*** vs $100.00) 3. Included a
	  Voucher check template. This is a full page check with the check
	  on top and which has two stubs below. There are other voucher
	  formats ( middle and bottom ) , but the check printing
	  functionality would require separate templates for the different
	  formats. Also changed the Quicken/Quickbooks US-Letter check
	  format to include the ADDRESS check item and blocking around the
	  AMOUNT_NUMBER field. I made a change to the Quicken-wallet check
	  to add blocking characters around the AMOUNT_NUMBER field, and I
	  added a clipping rectangle definition to the NOTES and PAYEE
	  fields the were placed in the check stub area ( if the fields
	  were too long, they would print into the check area ).

	* [r18572] src/bin/Makefile.am, src/bin/gnucash-gdb.in,
	  src/bin/gnucash-valgrind.in, src/bin/gnucash.in: Bug #606077:
	  Fix uncommon configure option --program-suffix. Patch by Peter
	  Selinger: OK, the attached patch fixes part of this problem.
	  Specifically, it applies the specified transform (from
	  ./configure option --program-suffix, --program-prefix, or
	  --program-transform-name) to the files src/bin/gnucash-valgrind
	  src/bin/gnucash-gdb src/bin/gnucash This is done in the Makefile
	  at compile time. In the end, I am not sure why the GnuCash
	  configure.in provides the --program-suffix mechanism at all,
	  since apparently it hasn't been used in 10 years. According to
	  info autoconf, these are supposed to be enabled by the macro
	  AC_ARG_PROGRAM, but I don't see this in configure.in. So perhaps
	  it has been enabled by accident and shouldn't really be there.

	* [r18555] src/report/standard-reports/balance-sheet.scm: Speed up
	  the balance sheet report by a factor of 5 or so by using C
	  functions instead of Scheme functions to get account commodity
	  balances. This idea is borrowed from the EGuile version of the
	  balance sheet report.

	* [r18553] src/register/ledger-core/split-register-model.c: Avoid
	  a bunch of assertion failures when the general ledger is open.
	  The general ledger has no account so attempts to get the balance
	  of the register's account pass a null account pointer to
	  functions that won't accept that. Also stop leaking a GList in
	  the functions that get account balances.

	* [r18552] src/engine/engine.i, src/libqof/qof/qofbook.h,
	  src/report/standard-reports/balance-sheet.scm: Remove the
	  "Compute unrealized gains and losses" option from the balance
	  sheet report. Instead compute unrealized gains and losses only
	  if the current book does not use trading accounts.

	  #602091: Fix broken Due Bill Reminder in all non-C locales The
	  Due Bill Reminder used the translated form of "Invoice" as query
	  string predicate, which can't work because the untranslated
	  string must be searched for.
